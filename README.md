# Tourism-Management-System
The project is on tourism management system. It is a website where users visit to access information about different places along with the facilities available and package cost. There is a need to keep a record of people who are interested to visit a particular location and also make sure that their trip is planned in a better way.  It is very important to maintain an efficient software to handle information of different bookings done by the users. This application provides a way to record these information and to access this in a simple way.
   <br>  The objective of the project is to develop a system that automates the processes of travel and tourism. The system maintains a centralized repository to make necessary travel arrangements and to retrieve information easily. The users can decide about the places they want to visit and make bookings online for travel and accomodations. This system also helps to promote responsible and interested tourism, so that people can enjoy their holidays at their favourable places.
